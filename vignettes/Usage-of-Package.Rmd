This package allows a user to be able to see the correlations between a dependent
variable in a dataset and either an individual dependent variable or multiple dependent
variables. There are different functions that allow for a user to be able to look at 
the correlations. The plot function allows the correlations to be seen visually. The 
print function allows the correlations to be seen in a chart. The summary function does not allow for all individual correlations to be seen, but provides a short script which contains what variables were looked at along with the range for the correlations, the median of the correlations, and how many variables had significant p-values.
