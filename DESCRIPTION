Description: This package contains 4 functions. The RXY function calculates the correlations between a dependent variable y and one or more independent x variables. The print function prints a table with the correlations between the dependent variable and the independent variable or variables. The plot function plots these correlations  and the summary function provides a written response of what independent variables and the dependent variables were compared along witht he median correlation, the range of correlations, and how many correlations had a significant p-value.
